Project Title : Customer Personality Analysis

Problem Statement:
Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers.
It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to
modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different
types of customers. Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its
product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For
example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the
company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely
to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.

The main objective -
1. What people say about your product: what gives customers’ attitude towards the
product.
2. What people do: which reveals what people are doing rather than what they are
saying about your product.

Approach : Unsupervised Learning
